This extension converts some simple ASCII punctuation sequences into “smart” punctuation HTML entities:

 - Converts straight quotes (`'` and `"`) into ‘curly’ quote HTML entities.
 - Converts dashes (`--` and `---`) into ‘en-dash’ and ‘em-dash’ HTML entities.
 - Converts three consecutive dots (`...`) into an ‘ellipsis’ HTML entities.
 - Converts `x` between numbers into a ‘times’ HTML entities.

This extension will not modify characters within `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<script>`, `<style>` and `<textarea>`
elements because these elements are commonly used to display text where smart quotes and other “smart punctuation” would
not be appropriate, such as in source code or sample markup.
